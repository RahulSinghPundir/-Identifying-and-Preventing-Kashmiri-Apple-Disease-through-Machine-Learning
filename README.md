# -Identifying-and-Preventing-Kashmiri-Apple-Disease-through-Machine-Learning
Developed machine learning models for early detection of plant infections in the vital Kashmiri apple industry, improving accuracy and speed of diagnosis to enable prompt action and protect crops.

“Apple” proudly represents the fruit industry of Kashmir, hereby representing about nighty-eight percent of the total fruit production in the valley. It is the backbone of the economy of Kashmir valley particular in Shopian district. Sadly, there has been no significant increase in the production of this industry during the last few years due to various reasons but one of the most prominent reasons is the infection spread across the crops. India is an agricultural nation, and it is an important issue for the prompt detection of diseases among plants. The early detection of apple plants will enable apple producers to take the necessary steps or precautions to save the fruits from infection. The manual or traditional methods for apple plant disease predictions are very time consuming and laborious, which includes the lab diagnoses to be provided. But here is where the new technology comes up, with the advent in machine learning and deep learning it is now possible to quickly determine if a plant is infected or not with a reliable accuracy.  


The findings of this study will be extremely beneficial to farmers and other Kashmiri apple growers, allowing them to implement countermeasures against contaminated trees. According to the study's findings, the predictive accuracy of the model for Apple Plant Disease Detection is 79.84% in the  
testing phase, which is excellent for prediction and assessment. This will mainly ensure that the model will predict the diseases correctly and will also help the farmers to detect all the diseases to take countermeasures. Based on the findings of this paper, subsequent researchers will have a lot simpler time working on more areas of this discipline and delivering high-quality research. As a result, our publication will serve as a more trustworthy source of information for everyone. We can surely make it better, as we all know there is always room for development and polishing. In addition to healthy plants, our model can identify three common diseases: apple rot, apple scab, and Alternaria leaf blotch which are most prominently found. This research can also help to design more robust models capable of detecting a wide range of disorders. The fusion of features from multiple networks can also be implemented or implanted. Furthermore, PCA and LDA which are the dimensionality reduction techniques can be used to obtain better and efficient   results. This research may also be utilised to not only construct models for Kashmir apples or any specific plant, but also to forecast illnesses in a range of plants at the same time. Other Convolutional models, such as R-CNN, faster R-CNN, and ResNet, may be used to assess the results in the future.
